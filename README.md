# K-Means Implementation Project in Java

This project is a Java implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm using the famous Iris dataset. The K-Means algorithm is widely used in machine learning and data mining to partition data points into distinct clusters based on their similarity.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a well-known benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning. It consists of measurements of various characteristics of Iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset contains a total of 150 instances, with each instance belonging to one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement the K-Means algorithm in Java and apply it to the Iris dataset. The steps involved in the implementation are as follows:

1. **Data Loading**: The Iris dataset is loaded from a CSV file into memory, allowing easy access to the data for further processing.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values or any other data inconsistencies. Additionally, the data is normalized or scaled if required to ensure accurate clustering results.

3. **K-Means Initialization**: The initial centroids for clustering are either randomly initialized or set using pre-defined centroids and labels.

4. **Clustering Iterations**: The K-Means algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the nearest centroid and recalculates the centroid positions based on the assigned points.

5. **Convergence**: The clustering process continues until the centroids stabilize or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

6. **Evaluation**: The final step involves evaluating the quality of the clustering results. This can be done by analyzing the clusters and their centroids.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

3. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE.

4. Build and compile the project.

5. Run the main class (`KMeans.java`) to start the K-Means clustering process on the Iris dataset.

## Dependencies

This project does not have any external dependencies. It uses only standard Java libraries to ensure ease of use and portability.
